Title: Front End Banking Application

Description: The Front End Banking Application allows you to create an account through the bad bank. You can also deposit and withdraw money, and keep track of the balance as you do so. 

How to Run: In order to run the front end banking application, download index.html, alldata.js, bank.png, context.js, createaccount.js, deposit.js, home.js, index.js, navbar.js, and withdraw.js into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser and click the navigation bar elements to navigate through the bad bank application.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be helpful to add additional styling elements. I would also like to add a login page to the application.
